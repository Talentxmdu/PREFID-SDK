## What is PrefID?

PrefID is an **identity infrastructure platform** that creates a portable preference graph — a structured representation of who you are, what you like, and how you work.

## The Problem We Solve

Every AI we interact with starts from scratch. **ChatGPT doesn't know what Claude knows.** Your coding assistant doesn't understand your music preferences.

We spend hours re-explaining ourselves, re-prompting the same context, again and again.

## The Solution

PrefID provides a **universal identity layer** that travels with you across every AI:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User authenticates via OAuth">
    Users grant your app permission to access their preference graph.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fetch domain-specific preferences">
    Request only the domains you need: music, travel, coding, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Personalize your AI">
    Inject preferences into your prompts for context-aware responses.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available Domains

PrefID organizes preferences into domain-specific graphs:

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `music_preferences` | Favorite artists, genres, streaming habits |
| `food_profile` | Dietary restrictions, cuisines, allergies |
| `travel_profile` | Airlines, hotels, travel style preferences |
| `coding_profile` | Languages, frameworks, editor preferences |
| `finance_profile` | Investment style, risk tolerance |
| `general_profile` | Name, communication style, interests |

## Quick Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.prefid.dev/v1/preferences/music_preferences" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

```json Response
{
  "domain": "music_preferences",
  "preferences": {
    "favorite_artists": ["AR Rahman", "Coldplay"],
    "genres": ["Indian Classical", "Electronic"],
    "streaming_service": "Spotify"
  },
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "last_updated": "2024-12-19T10:30:00Z"
}
```
